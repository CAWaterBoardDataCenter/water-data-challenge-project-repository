As a result, our project revolved around EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Detailed Facility Reports for Native American and Non-native areas. This outlined water quality violations for each location and provided insightful data that we used to create our interactive map and visualizations. We utilized web-scraping and their API to get access to the information we needed.

In addition, we used Census data to find the latitude, longitude, and zipcodes of each community, so we could best display them on our map.

While most of our backend work has been done from scratch, our website took inspiration from a previous California Water Data Challenge winner, http://calwaterquality.com/.","With our interactive tool, we hope to raise awareness for the major water quality issues present in Native American communities, not just in California, but throughout the western United States. The ability to compare Native American water quality with nearby non-native communities highlights the growing divide in access to clean water. Even when they are in the same geographical areas, Native American communities often have poorer water quality than Non-native communities. Our team hopes to bring this often overlooked issue to the fore.

We want our findings to inspire and fuel actions to protect these disadvantaged Native American communities and bring about change. We plan to present our findings to state and local governments to give a voice to a suppressed population.","We approached this broad water quality problem by focusing on a specific community that is in need of help. Often times, Native American difficulties and struggles are overlooked by others. We want to change that. By narrowing the focus of our project, we were able to have a more direct and substantial impact in the area of our research. 

While there are many tools to explore water quality in states such as California, we could not find any that had a specific focus on Native American Communities. In addition, none of the tools we came across had an option to compare the water quality of a certain place with nearby communities. Our Relative Quality Reports allow the user to do this. This provides a context for the results and data presented, and it highlights the major problem of clean water discrimination.","This is the most shocking statistic we came across in our findings: Native American communities are 30% more likely to have water quality violations than Non-Native communities. They also have a significantly higher chance of their violations going unaddressed and continuing to pose a threat to the local population. 

We outline and display all of these statistics and figures on our website and include many interactive visualizations to show a certain place’s frequency of specific contaminant violations (includes the names of contaminants), number of addressed and unaddressed violations, and a scatterplot comparing the Native American community to nearby non-native communities. Others can easily take our findings and use them to gain insight into certain communities and improve upon our work.

We also plan to make our cleaned data sets available on our website so others can use this data for their own purposes and bring further insight into this topic.","Being high school students, one of the biggest problems was finding time to work on this project. In between all the tests and quizzes, we pulled all-nighters to turn our idea into a reality, and it was definitely worth it.

Along with that, we also lacked major experience in the field of Data Science. While we, the team members, have taken courses and done research internships focused on Data Science, we had never gone out and done a project on our own, without any guidance from mentors or teachers. It was both a blessing and a curse: we learned to become independent and picked up skills that will last a lifetime, but also went through hours and hours of Stack Overflow and hectic Google searches :). 

In addition, a lot of the software we used was the “trial” or “basic” version, so we were limited by our resources. One example would be the Plotly visualization library. We had around 500 plots to display, but our API calls were limited to 100, so we had to create multiple accounts and continuously change our functions in order for the code to work.

Lastly, and most importantly, a lot of data was missing, so we had to manually input it. In situations where web-scraping wasn’t an option, we opened up the data sets ourselves and combed through each and every row to make sure we had as much quality data as possible. Our process involved a lot of data cleaning and improvement.

Now that we have the quality data, with access to better resources, we can easily scale our project.","Instagram: @ansh_motiani, @aditya10g, @samhith.k, #nativeamerican #water-quality #cleanwaterdiscrimination","Purify_Overview.mp4

We are leveraging over 13 years of technical development and field testing with universities, U.S. government labs and agencies, and commercial agriculture. Quaesta Instruments is a scientific firm that provides surface moisture sensing hardware systems and web-accessible data streams.

The surface water data we’re collecting is generated by these above-ground systems, which use proven cosmic-ray sensor (CRS) network technology that offers many advantages over existing methods. For example, one “box” placed on an irrigation pivot can continuously stream soil moisture data as it sweeps in a circle across a field, creating high resolution maps. 

These sensor networks (one sensor per field) make it practical to monitor water volume in soils, snowmass, and vegetation over very large areas to improve irrigation efficiency, monitor water supply, assess flood and fire hazard, and inform climate models.","Our goal is to introduce Cosmic Ray Sensor (CRS) data to the open water community, which likely is not aware of its existence, and begin an exploration of how it can improve water data quality and analysis and support wiser water management and public policy. 

Moisture at the land surface in the form of soil moisture, snow and vegetation water is critical to humans. Snowpack is important for water supply in most western states, and snowpack and soil moisture directly affect forests, weather and climate. Vegetation moisture content can help predict the effects of drought on crop yields and the likelihood of wildfire, and soil moisture and snowpack are important in predicting floods and landslides. Given the importance of surface moisture to our society, it should be well understood. But it is not. Spatial estimates of surface moisture are poor. 

We hypothesize that CRS data will help farm managers immediately make water use adjustments. For example, a web portal enables farmers to see their fields' soil moisture data in real-time and easily assess whether, when, and where it makes sense to irrigate or to conserve.","As the State of CA prepares to deploy water markets and data platforms to support them over the next few months, it’s a singularly important time to confirm that the data being used are reliable and usable as possible. We believe analysts and program leaders will be eager for an additional and independent data source that may help improve coverage, improve representativeness in space and time, reduce measurement errors, and support standardization and harmonization of data. Demonstrating the applicability of this data type and collection method may also prove a model for how large-scale surface water assessments can be conducted statewide, and as a model across the nation.","Academics evaluating our innovations have published numerous papers, which may be a good source for others wishing to reproduce that work and build on it from a technical and policy point of view. More importantly for the spirit of the Water Data Challenge, we wish to encourage innovation transfer now to policy makers, commercial agriculture, and community stakeholders.","Typical irrigation practices lack a data-driven feedback mechanism on field saturation -- water is simply turned on and off at certain times, or as a farmer chooses. This is exceedingly wasteful. Most soil moisture systems require the deployment of probes stuck into the ground. This approach is expensive to scale, hard to reconcile with farming operations (wires and ploughs do not mix well), and provides only point-sources of data which are inferior and even misleading because fields are not homogeneous -- a probe can only measure the soil it is immediately touching. 

The use of cosmic-ray sensors is a major innovation for monitoring soil moisture. They are cheap to scale (one per field, easily networked), can be mounted on equipment and vehicles to avoid interfering with farming operations, and data are highly accurate because the technique remotely senses the entire field repeatedly, providing high resolution heat maps, time series, and transects.

This technique makes it practical and more cost-effective to monitor soil moisture (a critical factor also in monitoring groundwater), vegetation water equivalent (plants in a field), and snow water equivalent all via open-source web distribution for analysis at multiple scales, from individual fields to drainage basins to regions comprising the entire State of CA. Such a data stream would be a valuable resource for county governments, water utilities, agriculture areas and farms, and well as colleges, universities, high schools, and middle schools (STEM education).",#upwardly-innovations #quaesta-instruments,,checked,28.0,14.0

- Water Quality Portal data from the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (https://www.waterqualitydata.us) for groundwater test data for inorganic and organic contaminants
- Area Deprivation Index (ADI) data from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu) to quantify disadvantaged neighborhoods

- Cartographic data from the US Census Bureau for spatial boundary information",Our goal is to provide a prototype approach of how researchers might quickly sift through large volumes of demographic and water quality data to identify important correlations that warrant further analysis/study.,"We believe that overlaying census and water quality data in a single geospatial plot, in addition to calculating important summary statistics on-the-fly, represents a novel approach to gaining insight into how water quality and population demographics interact at a variety of scales.  In addition, while we focused on ZIP code-level granularity for this prototype, our technique could be straightforwardly modified to operate at the census block-level, providing even finer granularity.","By leveraging only open-source datasets and tools (specifically, the Tableau Public business intelligence dashboard tool), and making our dashboard freely available for others to download and modify (https://public.tableau.com/views/CaliforniaWaterQualityCensus/WaterQualityCensusDashboard), we believe we have adopted the spirit of reproducible research and open collaboration.","The largest challenge we faced was the technical hurdle of joining multiple different datasets that all operated at different temporal and spatial resolutions.  The resultant data pipeline is able to process hundreds of thousands of data points in real-time.  This real-time process of exploratory data analysis is critical to facilitating data mining, i.e., interactive exploration of a large, multi-faceted dataset.

In principle, our approach is capable of working with a wide variety of water quality data.  We would find it especially interesting to expand the scope from wells to public utility drinking water.",,"Well-Known_walkthrough.mov

An estimated 1.5-2.5 million people in California rely on unregulated water sources (e.g., wells). These groups face two main vulnerabilities: (1) Vulnerability to water quantity changes: persistent droughts can lead to water scarcity. (2) Vulnerability to water quantity issues: lack of regulation and mobile cancer-causing contaminants (e.g., nitrates and arsenic from agriculture or industrial processes) can contaminate wells.   These vulnerabilities are further compounded by socio-economic constraints which can sometimes compromise all access to water. This project fits in the broader California Data Challenge scope of “Assessing What We Know,” since it brings together a myriad of spatial data from many different California-based organizations to better understand different types of vulnerabilities. The tool helps communities better understand the locations of populations that may be affected by drought and water contamination.","Detailed descriptions of the different data layers can be found here: https://drinkingwatertool.communitywatercenter.org/data/

Some datasets are results of calculations on the datasets. For example, to understand the drought scenarios, the groundwater depths from 2012-2016 are scaled by 0.5, 0.75, 1, where 1 represents the worst drought. Additional description of data and methodology can be found https://drinkingwatertool.communitywatercenter.org/data/

For technology, we built on Wordpress and Django, two widely used open source web platforms. Wordpress allows for flexible content editing and access to a wide range of plugins. Django integrates with Postgres/PostGIS for spatial reporting. We use a range of other open source tools, including Leaflet.js, Bootstrap.js, and Mapserver.","The first goal is educational. The tool enables users to learn and discover their water supply system. With a simple interface, the first tool just requires an address. This information allows the user to learn who manages water in their neighborhood and describes the different agencies that may be involved (community water systems, GSAs). This section is informative for users to learn about maximum contaminant levels, consumer confidence reports, and more generally get involved with local water issues.

The second goal is exploratory. With the web mapping tool, users can dive deeper into California's many water data layers. Different users can use the data to learn about water quality and water supply. 

This project is a collaborative, creative, and transparent effort to understand water vulnerability particularly with respect to wells in California. With access to the data, the user can quickly identify many types of vulnerability. For example, the user can explore spatially which community water system is serving disadvantaged communities (socio-economically vulnerable). The user can learn where declining groundwater elevations due to droughts can affect water access (vulnerable to water quantity changes). The user can understand where people are affected by different contaminants (vulnerability to water quality).

The tool has features for many different types of users. Policy and decision makers can use the tool to review groundwater sustainability plans and plan for drought resilient communities. Researchers can quickly download the data to run their own analysis. Residents can enter their addresses and find out who supplies their water.","There are many unique features to this project and three to highlight include:

1 - Combining both water quantity and water quality data into one tool showcases the different types of vulnerabilities that can exist and treats water more holistically.

2 –  The entire system is available in both English and Spanish. In a moment where society aims to understand how to be inclusive, particularly when discussing vulnerable communities, the Drinking water vulnerability tool has started to make inclusion a central part of data and design by accommodating the second-largest language spoken in the state (Spanish ~25%).

3 – The tool offers features along a wide range of use cases, from the simple educational information of who provides water at a specific address to the deeper-dive of many data layers combinations and research questions, the tool can serve a very broad group of people and help them better identify water vulnerabilities for others and for themselves.","The tool has been used by the Community Water Center’s staff for both community organizing and legislative advocacy. At launch, the tool was covered by Capitol Public Radio (http://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/02/13/california-may-be-sliding-back-into-drought-lawmakers-and-advocates-warn-now-is-the-time-to-prepare/) and KSBW TV in Monterey (https://www.ksbw.com/article/new-online-interactive-tool-helps-californians-prepare-for-future-drought/30900500#).

Residents in places like Twentynine Palms and Ventura can quickly see their water systems have high levels of Hexavalent Chromium (cancer-causing) contamination. Anyone with a domestic well around Chino can learn about risks of high nitrate levels. And residents of the Sacramento Valley can see how their GSAs face higher costs for domestic well remediation than elsewhere in the state.

Drought scenarios are applied in the Central Valley and we can see the impact of increasing drought severity in Fresno, Merced, and Modesto. These cities are already in critically overdrafted basins. By looking at the GSA level scale we can see how the number of impacted domestic wells changes with different scenarios with both Merced and Modesto reaching number of impacted wells at more than 26 the highest category at scenario 100% and Fresno already having this designation at the scenario 50%. With respect to quality, we can explore Arsenic near Mercer where it is present in both community water systems and to a greater extent in groundwater private domestic wells. Atwater just north of Mercer seems to have 1-2-3 Trichlorpropane contamination in both community water systems and in private domestic wells at levels more than 200% the MCL. This area is predominantly Hispanic/Latinx. 

Exploring Atwater offers insights on the relationship between vulnerability and equity since the user can compare the areas that have regulated community water systems and associated 1-2-3 Trichloropropane levels and the surrounding unregulated domestic wells and their associated contamination. Furthermore, the stark distinction in income suggests part of the difference may be socio-economic.","Three challenges during the project included:
1 – Aggregating wells to comply with privacy concerns.  Although well data was often available at higher resolution, it was important to aggregate well to US Public Land Survey Systems. This also enabled a calculation of likelihood that an area was served by a well when no well location was available.

2 – Identifying the right audience. One of the difficulties is identifying who the audience and users of the tool will be. This project aimed to build a tool for the general public, but this group may include advocates, policy-makers, researchers. This requires designing different features for different users. Consequently, building something for a general public is the most complicated tool of all to build!

3 – Developing a clear, consistent, and agreed-upon measure of a “safe” or “vulnerable” would make a tool like this much easier for the general public to understand. Without that definition, it’s impossible to present a truly simple and immediately actionable message around “how safe is my water?”","Twitter: @greeninfo, @CWaterC, @SHE_Lab__","Water_Data_Challenge_Final.mp4

PFAS, or per and poly fluoroalkyl substances is a class of over 4,000 chemicals. Although they have been used since the 1940’s, it is not until recent years that regulations in drinking water have begun. The CA State Water Board began monitoring PFAS in drinking water in the UCMR 3 which then led to quarterly testing in 2019. With this new research and testing comes new data in which we need to analyze.","The project’s data is as follows:

This project is a continuation of the PFAS– We Eat It, We Drink It, We Breathe It project. This project was made possible through a few datathons in 2019, as well as a proprietary test dataset that has since been published. We took the data format from last year's PFAS project and modeled this year's data after it.","The goal of this project is to bring awareness as well as reduce time taken to analyze the data. Although data analytics is a growing field, many water providers may not have the personnel to analyze their test data. With the PFAS Analysis and Intervention Application a user can upload their test data to analyze or look at prior efforts test data.
We have also created a data warehouse using Google BigQuery, to create a dedicated location for our open-source project to pull from actively. The impact of having a dedicated area with reliable data pipelines is the data will be easily updated and available to be used for anyone.","Our approach is different because we have gathered, transformed, and made a unique data store that is meant strictly for our application. This application not only analyzes publicly available data, but it can analyze user inputted data. The topic of PFAS is still widely unknown thus why it is compelling. PFAS notification and response levels in drinking water were first set in 2018 and in 2020 the response level was lowered as the PFAS statewide investigation continues.","The project leverages historical precipitation data from NOAA, as well as spatial data to visualize what possible sources of PFAS could be in the vicinity of a test site. For some test sites, the precipitation data shows a spike in precipitation, and in the following days, the test data shows a spike in some PFAS levels. Recognizing this pattern can lead to wanting to know if there are landfills in the area causing PFAS leaching. The app provides the necessary precipitation data as well as the landfill locations to this type of analysis.  
If the precipitation data does not spike when there is a rise in PFAS levels, what is the cause? This pattern is the reason why there are other location points such as military sights and DTSC hazardous waste sites also plotted in the vicinity of the test site to possibly identify the source.

The working application is hosted on shinyapp.io: https://meldataaa.shinyapps.io/PFAS_Analysis_and_Intervention/

The GitHub repository can be accessed here: https://github.com/meldataaa/PFAS_Analysis_and_Intervention","One challenge we faced early in the project was transforming the data. The data was originally only available in DBF format. We tried to transform the data, but the resulting files were still somewhat corrupt and needed extra cleaning. Luckily, the database files are now available in CSV format, which is easier and more comfortable to use. 
From a data perspective, data is not always readily accessible. Locating the correct data takes the most time. For a while, we could not find the supporting data we needed to complete a feature of the application. We even considered stopping the project. In November, the data we needed was posted, and we started up work again.
The precipitation data is hosted on the National Climatic Data Center which can often be slow and unreliable. When testing the application, we often thought there were issues with the app but the NCDC server was down. If the NCDC server is down the application may not function properly.

For a more significant impact to occur, we would need: 
All publicly available data on a server that is easily queriable to avoid having to periodically download the needed data as well as avoiding the location of data from changing.
Marketing and user research to ensure people know about our project.

Renewable freshwater resources (RFWR) are critical for managing water risk. While only 2.5% of the Earth’s water is available as freshwater, most of it is inaccessible to humans and only a tiny fraction of it is available in the rivers & streams as usable & renewable supply. As such, the flow of rivers is the best estimate of available RFWR. Globally, however, humans only use less than 10% of the annual discharge in rivers. Then, why is water scarcity still a problem? It is because the water is unequally distributed, both in time and space. In addition, this circulating resource, unlike any other, is heavily modified by climate and human abstractions. While water shapes our society, we shape our water resources.    In California, this challenge is particularly salient. In 2017, the state was still recovering from the recent mega drought, followed by a mega flood, which triggered failure at the state’s largest dam in Oroville and created havoc for emergency managers and planners. Such events will only get worse in the future. Researchers, government, nonprofit, and public initiatives, therefore, seek innovative approaches to help communities across the board deal with any such future events and avoid the negative consequences.    At its root, the problem is the availability of the right kind of data on how much water is available, where it is, and when to expect it. Will there be enough RFWR to grow crops? Where will wildfire fighters find RFWR to protect lives and property? Will there be additional failures to the ancient water infrastructure? River flow data in CA is sporadic. Less than 10% of the locations where we collect river flow data are “naturally flowing”. That means human influence  over 90% of the locations from which we are collecting data become practically unpredictable.  In addition, over 84% locations of the data collection sites across the state have some form of missing data. These data problems are real and need urgent attention.       Adopting an interdisciplinary framework, and using California’s State Water Project - one of the country’s biggest and best managed water sources - our team of subject matter experts, social scientists, and AI-modelers, conducted a year-long project to solve the puzzle. By leveraging a user-centered approach and state-of-the-art applications of Deep Learning, we developed a highly predictive tool and web applications for water managers to strengthen decision making, transform the sector, and identify opportunities for risk mitigation.","USGS streamflow data

https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/applications/","Goals:
To improve the quality, usability, and reproducibility of RFWR data and data-enabled analysis per the Challenge
To develop a prediction system for RFWR and associated risk, which is usable, dynamic, publicly-available-data-driven, reproducible, AND time and resource efficient

The ability to predict and project renewable freshwater resources has many impacts, which include allowing
Water managers in cities and towns to plan for delivering drinking water to the almost 40 million Californians
Wildfire fighters to plan on where to draw water and where to stage equipment so they can save lives and property
Businesses, such as canoe rental companies, that depend on tourism to plan for their seasons
Farmers to understand how much water will be available for irrigation in a timely manner so they can continue to feed the nation 
Water quality monitors to estimate total maximum daily loads of pollutants, which reflect whether the water body meets standards for public health and healthy ecosystems.","Building and deploying a tool to predict renewable freshwater resources requires a multidisciplinary and systems change approach. This system approach, which examined the different elements and their interconnections, make our project compelling and well-positioned to achieve scale and impact. For instance, we have established interdisciplinary partnerships across the environmental, social, and physical sciences. Drawing from a range of theoretical and applied frameworks, we have developed a deep understanding of basic hydrology and the needs of stakeholders, namely water managers. We discovered through field work that water prediction for non-reference (human modified) water locations represents one of the main pain points for water managers, thus impacting decision making in a complex web of water-related initiatives. For this reason, our interdisciplinary and systems-based approach allowed us to discover innovative solutions that we believe will scale across hydrological systems, which exist across the globe.","First, we found that we could predict surface water flow much farther into the future than anyone else had done. While the US Forest Service and others make forecasts of up to 6-8 months in advance, our predicted data suggests we can comfortably predict one year into the future. Indeed, we can actually predict one, two or perhaps more years into the future. While there is more uncertainty the farther out the forecast, our models give users the ability to plan for date ranges that they could never access before. Think of the applications for more accurate future forecasts. Firefighters could better plan the placement of equipment to fight fires based on water availability in forest fire zones. Farmers could update their crop choice and planting decisions depending on whether to expect a wetter or dryer year. 

Second, we also found that we could forensically reconstruct the data from impaired or even abandoned surface water flow sensors. About 84% of all water sensors in California have medium to substantial data gaps. Those gaps rendered data from those sensors unusable for climate monitoring or analysis. But using our models, we reconstructed the data for sites with large gaps. Our outputs demonstrate the fine-grained accuracy of our data reconstruction. Using this treasure trove of additional data, we can refine our own forecasts and reduce the uncertainty in our predictions. Further, we plan to release these reconstructed time-series data to the public so that scholars may incorporate this data into their own research.

Our team is committed to public release and public use of our project results. The first component for public use is the interactive web tool, which is currently hosted on a simple Heroku instance. The tool provides a visual front end to display all of the sensor locations, as well as plots of the different model forecasts and data reconstructions. This tool allows non-technical users to locate their nearest sensors and review the surface water forecasts most relevant to their needs. 

Second, we also plan to release our forensically reconstructed sensor datasets for public use, once we have adequately benchmarked our results and allowed for peer review of our methods. However, once these two steps are complete, we look forward to contributing our data to the other publicly available natural resource data portals that inform governmental and business decisions around the State. 

Finally, once our data are publicly released, we plan to offer workshops for interested parties such as the USGS, the California Department of Water Resources, public utilities providers, and any other users interested in water availability in California.","Our team tackled multiple challenges, which serve as an exemplary case not just in California, but also around the world. For example, there are many challenges surrounding data quality and availability, which are prevalent in other hydrological systems all around the nation & world. Using state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to identify and augment available data sources was a critical step in building robust predictive models. Furthermore, this team showcases how solving these complex problems requires the integration of multiple stakeholders and social actors, including academics, researchers, government, philanthropy, among others. Getting everyone at the same table is a major challenge in the field. However, our team succeeded by building a nurturing environment for people with a diverse set of skills, which despite being  completely volunteer-driven maintained our relationships, support, and respect for each other's expertise. We believe that our team structure, organization, and governance could serve as an example for similar initiatives.",LinkedIn group : https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9024740/ ; Google group email : hydrodetectus@googlegroups.com; Google drive : HydroDetectus,"CWDC-Vid_try5.mp4

An estimated 1.5-2.5 million people in California rely on unregulated water sources (e.g., wells). These groups face two main vulnerabilities:  •	Vulnerability to water quantity changes: persistent droughts can lead to water scarcity •	Vulnerability to water quantity issues: lack of regulation and mobile cancer-causing contaminants (e.g., nitrates and arsenic from agriculture or industrial processes) can contaminate wells These vulnerabilities are further compounded by socio-economic constraints which can sometimes compromise all access to water.  This project fits in the broader California Data Challenge scope of “Assessing What We Know,” since it brings together a myriad of spatial data from many different California-based organizations to better understand different types of vulnerabilities. The tool helps communities better understand the locations of populations that may be affected by drought and water contamination.","Detailed descriptions of the different data layers can be found here: https://drinkingwatertool.communitywatercenter.org/data/

Some datasets are results of calculations on the datasets. For example, to understand the drought scenarios, the groundwater depths from 2012-2016 are scaled by 0.5, 0.75, 1, where 1 represents the worst drought. Additional description of data and methodology can be found https://drinkingwatertool.communitywatercenter.org/data/","The first goal is educational. The tool enables users to learn and discover their water supply system. With a simple interface, the first tool just requires an address. This information allows the user to learn who manages water in their neighborhood and describes the different agencies that may be involved (community water systems, GSA’s). This section is informative for users to learn about maximum contaminant levels, consumer confidence reports and more generally get involved with local water issues.
The second goal is explorative.   With the web mapping tool, users can dive deeper into California's many water data layers. Different users can use the data to learn about water quality and water supply. 
This project is a collaborative, creative, and transparent effort to understand water vulnerability particularly with respect to wells in California. With access to the data, the user can quickly identify many types of vulnerability. For example, the user can explore spatially which community water system is serving disadvantaged communities (socio-economically vulnerable). The user can learn where declining groundwater elevations due to droughts can affect water access (vulnerable to water quantity changes). The user can understand where people are affected by different contaminants (vulnerability to water quality).
The tool has a feature for many different types of users. Policy and decision makers can use the tool to review groundwater sustainability plans and plan for drought resilient communities. Researchers can quickly download the data to run their own analysis. Furthermore, due to the myriad of data sets that are presented, the user can ask many different questions.","There are many unique features to this project and three to highlight include:

1 - Combining both water quantity and water quality data into one tool begins to showcase the different types of vulnerabilities that can exist and treats water more holistically 

2 – In a moment where society aims to understand how to be inclusive, particularly when discussing vulnerable communities, the Drinking water vulnerability tool has started to make inclusion a central part of data and design by accommodating the 2nd largest language spoken in the state (Spanish ~25%). The web page is available in both English and Spanish.

3 – The tool offers a feature for everyone, from the simple educational information of who provides the user water to the deeper-dive with many data layers combinations and research questions, the tool can serve a very broad group of people and help them better identify water vulnerabilities for other and for themselves.","Despite living in CA for a long time, it wasn’t until using the tool, that I learned who my water providers are and saw that the quality of my water was quite reasonable without a need to worry about levels beyond the regulation of As, N, Cr6 and 1,2,3-TCP. However, in exploring the deeper dive, I could not say the same about Joshua Tree National Park and Twentynine Palms which has high levels of Hexavalent Chromium (cancer-causing) contamination and are classified as disadvantaged and severely disadvantaged areas.

The drought scenarios are applied in the Alluvial Boundary and we can see the impact of increasing drought severity in Fresno, Merced, and Modesto. These cities are already in critically over drafted basins. By looking at the GSA level scale we can see how the number of impacted domestic wells changes with different scenarios with both Merced and Modesto reaching number of impacted wells at more than 26 the highest category at scenario 100% and Fresno already having this designation at the scenario 50%. With respect to quality, we can explore Arsenic near Mercer where it is present in both community water systems and to a greater extent in groundwater private domestic wells. Atwater just north of mercer seems to have 1-2-3 Trichlorpropane contamination in both community water systems and in private domestic wells at levesl more than 200% the MCL. This area is predominantly Hispanic/latinx. 

Exploring the city of Atwater offers insights on the relationship between vulnerability and equity since the user can compare the areas that have regulated community water systems and associated 1-2-3 Trichloropropane levels and the surrounding unregulated domestic wells and their associated contamination. Furthermore, the stark distinction in income suggests part of the different may be socio-economic.","Challenges encountered during the project included:
1 – Aggregating wells to comply with privacy concerns.  Although well data was often available at higher resolution, it was important to aggregate well to US Public Land Survey Systems. This also enabled a calculation of likelihood that an area was served by a well when no well location was available.
2 – Identifying the right audience. One of the difficulties is identifying who the audience and users of the tool will be. This project aimed to build a tool for the general public, but this group may include advocates, policy-makers, researchers. This requires designing different features for different users. Consequently, building something for a general public is the most complicated tool of all to build!",Twitter: @greeninfo,"Water_Data_Challenge_Final.mp4

This project develops our understanding of the relationships between declining groundwater levels and the scale of well failure, as well as the costs associated with well failure. The easily downloadable data and decision-support tool allows GSAs, the state, and communities to understand this relationship and potentially create policies and programs to protect domestic wells. 

We would like to see this website used widely by community, GSAs, and the state. Already, Leadership Counsel has shared gspdrywells.com with two residents of impacted communities, with staff from the State Water Resources Control Board, and with approximately 15 environmental and social justice organizations. Ideally, communities within the assessed GSPs will be able to understand this component of their GSP and advocate for changes, if needed. Additionally, the methodology and code can be used by anyone currently developing MTs in their GSP boundaries. Finally, DWR can use this information to contextualize their assessment of GSPs in the San Joaquin Valley by understanding the range of options and impacts of 10 - 300ft of groundwater decline below present day levels. ","Our estimates of domestic well failure count, percentage, and cost agree with two other studies (Bostic, et. al. 2020 and EKI 2020), and suggest failure on the order of thousands of wells if groundwater levels fall to minimum threshold levels specified in GSPs. Unlike other studies, gspdrywells.com is web-based, and allows users to run adaptive management scenarios to plan for differing amounts of well failure, all in a web browser. Results suggest that planning and management actions can be taken now to address vulnerabilities before domestic well users lose access to water. With interactive data visualization and a dedicated “Data” subpage with downloadable datasets and model output, gspdrywells.com aims to democratize data and model access, and reduce friction in incorporating domestic well protection measures in the GSP process. 

The results of the project are incredibly timely for current groundwater management processes in the San Joaquin Valley. GSAs are currently starting to implement their Groundwater Sustainability Plans in the San Joaquin Valley. Advocates working alongside low income communities of color have been advocating for years for more protective groundwater management policies and impact mitigation programs. GSAs are often wary to establish impact mitigation programs because of a lack of clear understanding of the costs of such a program. With this tool, agency staff and stakeholders can more clearly understand how much it would likely cost to mitigate dry well impacts, and can more clearly see the financial tradeoffs between setting more protective minimum thresholds and mitigating dry wells. ","In the critically overdrafted basins examined in this research, we estimate significant domestic well failure if minimum thresholds are reached. On the order of 12-99% wells are projected to fail in individual GSAs, and well failure across all GSAs combined is estimated to be 61-63%, or 9,281 - 9,651 domestic well failures, at a cost of $109.2 - 115.8M. Well failure is most severe in areas where groundwater levels are already low due to historical overdraft, and where large concentrations of relatively shallow domestic wells are located.

Leadership Counsel has shared gspdrywells.com with two residents of impacted communities, with staff from the State Water Resources Control Board, and with approximately 15 environmental and social justice organizations. Residents of impacted communities were glad to see impacts on their drinking water access displayed in such a clear way, and plan to use gspdrywells.com to ask their local agencies for policies and programs that better protect drinking water access. Partner organizations applauded the tool and its interactive features, and have used it to help show the State Water Resources Control Board how widespread and severe the impacts to drinking water access will be in the San Joaquin Valley, and urge the SWRCB’s action to avoid these impacts. Leadership Counsel and two other partner organizations have designed a presentation to GSAs that uses the tool to show local impacts in the GSA area and ask for measures to protect drinking water access. 

All data, code, and methods are available on gspdrywells.com and are easily downloadable. Methods can be used by consultants writing GSPs to assess well failure across many different groundwater decline scenarios, thus simplifying planning and management hurdles that rely on the development of costly well failure models. Municipalities, water districts, and other users of public supply wells can compare their well depths to MTs in their region and perform a localized analysis. The Water Board and DWR can use this tool to assess GSPs in terms of their consideration of the Human Right to Water (HR2W) and ‘significant and unreasonable’ impacts of MTs.","We faced methodological challenges in reading and scraping minimum threshold data from PDFs of submitted GSPs, as well as technical challenges in designing and coding a web interface. We decided to move away from the traditional server-UI model, for a JAMStack style static site which reduced loading time, increased site security, and is generally much easier to serve to multiple people at once (better load balancing).

Buy-in from state and local agencies would help scale the project’s impact. We aim to reduce the friction in integrating well protection planning into the GSP framework. We focused on critical priority basins because well failure is expected to be the highest here, and because these GSPs were already written. Moreover, we emphasized domestic wells because these tend to be the most shallow. In the future, we would like to expand our work to encompass public supply wells, and in medium and low priority basins. We believe that by continuing to develop these tools, we will help realize the Human Right to water for underserved Californians in groundwater-dependent regions.

To achieve these goals, additional funding is needed. One potential funding model would include a consortium of participating GSPs who jointly fund the development of these tools, and who share updated MO and MT data as it becomes available to keep the tool up-to-date.",@RichPauloo; @AmaM0na; @darcybostic,"2021-01-30_09-43-27_Trim.mp4

This is entirely new work.,"The sdwisard R package is an easy-to-use, open-source query tool for California drinking water quality data in the SDWIS database. Analysts can use sdwisard to create reproducible, open-source workflows that rapidly and programmatically acquire machine-readable, pre-cleaned, drinking water quality data. Our goal is to demonstrate a modern and reproducible data workflow centered around APIs, databases, and code. 

We aim to shift the conversation about data warehousing towards the use of modern API infrastructure by demonstrating what can be done if this infrastructure were already in place. An API wrapper is but one example. With a SDWIS API in place, any web service, researcher, or analyst could make requests for data from that API. Thus, sdwisard presents a case for a SDWIS external API, and also provides a tool that analysts, data scientists, and researchers can use today to improve the reproducibility of their workflows. Because the tool is open source, anyone can improve this tool and contribute to our CA Open Water Github organizational profile.","In California, present sources of water quality information are fragmented across thousands of water utilities and lack consistency and clarity. Moreover, although the state has identified open and transparent water data as critical to inform water management and achieve goals set in Human Right to Water, analysts remain hampered by a paucity of easy-to-use, open-source tools to acquire and analyze water quality data.


Sdwisard demonstrates the utility of easy-to-use API wrappers that empower analysts to get more done with data with less effort. Because the tool is open source, anyone can improve this tool and contribute to our CA Open Water Github organizational profile.","We developed a website for the v0.1 release of the sdwisard software (https://caopenwater.github.io/sdwisard/index.html), that includes installation instructions and a getting started vignette that explains how to use the tool. The github page with the R code for this project is here: https://github.com/CAopenwater/sdwisard, and the source code is available under the Creative Commons License: https://caopenwater.github.io/sdwisard/LICENSE.html","SDWIS does not have an API. We wanted to demonstrate why an API is important by developing one example of a tool (e.g., sdwisard) that could exist if the API was real. How do you build a query tool without an API? The answer, is to build a faux-API and a query tool around that faux-API. We used an s3 bucket on Amazon Web Services to host clean SDWIS data, and designed sdwisard to operate as if it were querying a real API. If and when the SDWIS API becomes a real thing, it will be relatively easy to direct the endpoints in sdwisard towards the real API.

To scale our project for greater impact, we need a real-life SDWIS API and the broad use of sdwisard as a tool for fetching SDWIS data. Before the API is built, we need resources to pay for requests that people make to the s3 bucket where data is currently hosted (these costs are minimal, but could become significant if the tool was broadly used).","@RichPauloo (Twitter, github), @thesadie (github), @ergz (github)",sdwisard_intro.docx,checked,43.0,21.5
