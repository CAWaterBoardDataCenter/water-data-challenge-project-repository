### Project Description:

The Governor’s May 16 Executive Order (B-37-16) calls for the development of water use targets customized to the unique conditions of each urban water agency as part of a new, permanent efficiency framework. The CaDC Efficiency Explorer is an interactive dashboard that supports the California water community in analyzing the impact of those new standards through a easy to use scenario explorer tool.
 The video in the attached powerpoint demonstrates the Efficiency Explorer’s functionality at an inter-agency level and at an intra-agency level.
