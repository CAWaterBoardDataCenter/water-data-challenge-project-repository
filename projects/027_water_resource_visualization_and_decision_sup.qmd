### Project Description:

We designed and prototyped an integrated water data modeling, visualization, and decision support tool as an example of how such tools can:
 • Enhance understanding of current and projected state-wide water demand in various scenarios
 • Identify possible water conservation and supply tactics to minimize risks to the agricultural industry 
 • Improve stakeholder engagement and communication 
 • Support water policy planning and decision making
 While our prototype demonstrates effective dashboard functionality and design using placeholder data, we’ve also outlined related datasets and a rapid prototyping approach that could be used for further development.
