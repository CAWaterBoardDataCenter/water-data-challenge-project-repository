### Project Description

Our innovation is a real-time data collection method for field-scale (and larger) sensing of soil moisture, snowmass, and vegetation that may be used to ground-truth, calibrate, complement, and augment the current methods of estimating surface water data at these scales -- critical inputs for water markets and implementation of the SGMA, including the soon to be unveiled OpenET (evapotranspiration) platform which uses estimates from satellite imagery, not proximal measures.
