### Project Description:

With declining water sales, water managers have lost over $675 million of revenue in the current drought. The CaDC rate comparison tool provides a quick way to see the implications that a rate shift or a drought surcharge would have on revenue and typical customer bills. The tool quickly illustrates the impact of a shift before a utility hires a rate consultant and goes through a full, labor intensive Prop 218 process. 
 You can see a video demo of the tool in action here: https://youtu.be/mYv-OOBGJ28
